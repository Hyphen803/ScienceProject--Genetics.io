            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>We've already established that DNA is incredibly powerful, but its also incredibly expensive at around 3500$ per megabyte which in turn defeats the whole purpose of having large amounts of storage. DNA also is far slower than the average hard drive; its around the speed of a USB drive; making the ultra high cost for very little storage not worth it.</p>

            <h2>How can DNA be fabricated?</h2>
            <p>The first step in lowering the cost of Genetic storage is finding a way to fabricate it cheaply and reliably. The DNA has to also be able to be written on and edited so you can't just use any sort of regular DNA. when using DNA as a storage device generally you need to sythesize a new strand of DNA every time you write a new piece of data, this favors using many smaller strands over using one larger one</p>
