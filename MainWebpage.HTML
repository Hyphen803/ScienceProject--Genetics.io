    <h3><a href=Definitions.HTML> Inergral Definition</a></h3>
    <p> Genetic storage is quite different from standard SSDs or HDDs so I would reccomend reading through the definitions first to have a better experince reading through the other pages.</p>

    <h3><a href=WhyIsDNASoEffective.HTML>Why is DNA so Effective?</a></h3>
    <p> DNA is so effective because it is so small, and it can store in trits DNA is ridicoulsly space efficent. DNA is also very durable and can last for thousands of years.</p>

    <h3><a href=DnaAndNeural.HTML>DNA Vs Neural Networks</a></h3>
    <p> DNA and Neural Networks are both very powerful tools in the world of data storage and processing, but they are very different in how they work and what they are used for.</p>

    <h3><a href=HowWillThisBecomeRealistic.HTML>How Will This Become Realistic?</a></h3>
    <p> Genetic storage is already technically possible however it is outrageously expensive and still very slow, but there are some key this that can happen to make it way more realistic in the future</p>
