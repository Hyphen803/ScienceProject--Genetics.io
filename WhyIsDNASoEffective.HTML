            <h2>What is DNA?</h2>
            <p>DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is incredibly good at storing data. 
                for refrence one strand of human DNA contains 3 Billion <i>base pairs</i>,
                 each of which can be 0,1, or 2 because its <i>encoded</i> in <i>terinary</i>(so it has a total of 3^3,000,000,000 possible combinations). all of this is stored in <b>6e-12g</b> of
                  space too (.0000000000006) which is ridicoulsly efficent compared to any other storage method.</p>

            <h2>How DNA Works</h2>
            <p>DNA contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop, survive, and reproduce. 
                However DNA could be used to also store other instructions or documents, because it can 
                store <i>terinary</i> data this makes it more efficent my a multiplicitave step than </p>

            <h3>Why Base 3?</h3>
            <p>DNA has 4 bases making you assume that data stored on DNA would use base 4, however having the same base in a row can cause reading errors so we use base 3 instead where the next base determines what it means <i>[Fig B]</i></p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>DNA is incredibly effective due to its ability to store absurd amounts of data in ridicoulsly small spaces and due to its crazy power efficency too.</p>
